# Copilot: Trust and Integration

## Background
- Early Copilot release deployed to Microsoft support engineers using Dynamics.  
- No prior baseline for AI trust, usefulness, or productivity.  
- Goal: define, measure, and track **trust in AI** during adoption.  

## Method
- **Longitudinal survey** across multiple waves (1-4) with samples ranging from 6 to 6,000 engineers (over time).  
- Developed **AI Composite Trust Score** combining accuracy, usefulness, productivity.  
- Applied **nonparametric stats** (Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney U) and **key driver analysis** (Adj. R² > .73).  
- **12 qualitative interviews** (60 mins each) for in-depth exploration.  
- Thematic analysis of open-text feedback.  

## Problem
- Users found Copilot easy to use but **did not trust outputs** due to:  
    - Hallucinations  
    - Broken/mismatched sources  
    - Inconsistent results  
- Only ~40% reported tasks felt easier; many said time was wasted double-checking AI answers.
- Lack of context made Copilot difficult for consistent use 

## Solution
- Designed and led a **multi-wave trust survey** to measure adoption barriers.  
- Operationalized trust signals (accuracy, reliability, and perceived usefulness).  
- Identified **top pain points** and **bright spots** (e.g., Case Summary seen as reliable and helpful).  
- Delivered **actionable insights** directly to design and product leaders.  

## How I Did It
- Built and validated a **repeatable Composite Trust Score** for AI evaluation.  
- Integrated telemetry, survey results, and interviews into one trust framework.  
- Translated findings into design directions and roadmap decisions.  
- Partnered with execs to set adoption guardrails based on evidence.  

## Impact
- Created Microsoft’s **first baseline for AI trust measurement** in support engineering (still used to this day for AI assessment).  
- Directly influenced roadmap: scale-back until accuracy/reliability improved + focus on Case Summary feature.  
- Secured investment in fixing broken outputs before global expansion.  
- **Case Summary feature** earned 90%+ thumbs-up, boosting sentiment and adoption.  
- The trust-measurement model became a **blueprint for future AI rollouts**.
